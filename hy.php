                <p>My name is Bonnie Yang. I am a senior at the University of Rochester studying Neurobiology and Clinical Psychology, and taking a cluster in German. Until two months ago, I was also planning to minor in Computer Science, but that is no longer possible for scheduling reasons. </p>

                <p>I've been a member of U of R's Fencing club since freshman year, and I took over the job of vice president last winter. Before I came to Rochester, I went to high school in Shanghai, China, where I was born and raised. </p>

                    <p>I wasn't planning on joining any clubs when I first came here, but I still went to the club fair because I was bored that afternoon. I walked past someone holding a sword, and I heard a voice in my head: "I should do that. " And that's how I, probably the least coordinated, least athletic person, ended up in a sports club. </p>

                    <p>I became the club's photographer the second year, mostly by accident. It was the first tournament after our last photographer had just graduated, and I happen to have my camera in the bag I brought with me. Here're some photos I've taken since then: </p>

                    <h2>Major</h2>
                    <h3>Brain & Cognitive Sciences</h3>

                    <p>I was undecided in my major for a while, and I started to think about choosing BCS as my major because of its wide variety of courses. As a somewhat interdisciplinary major, I'll need to take classes related to linguistics, optics, computer science, as well as psychology and neuroscience. </p>

                    <p>Like most people in my major, I started in the Perception and Action track. Eventurally, I decided to switch into the Neurobiology and Neuropsychology track in my junior year because I noticed the parts that attracted me the most were related to neurobiology and
                    neuroanatomy. </p>
